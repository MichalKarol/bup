Notable changes in main (incomplete)
====================================

May require attention
---------------------

* `bup fsck --quick` now checks the packfile indexes too.  Previously
  it only checked the packfiles.

* `bup fsck --generate` and `--repair` now exit immediately with an
  error when a suitable par2 isn't available.  Previously `--generate`
  would just print "skipped".

Thanks to (at least)
